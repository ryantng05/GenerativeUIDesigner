## Code Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use strict typing (no `any` unless necessary)
- Export types from schemas
- Document complex types

### React
- Use functional components
- Use hooks appropriately
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use client components only when needed

### Styling
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive approach
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Use semantic color names

### Code Style
- Use Prettier for formatting (if configured)
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
