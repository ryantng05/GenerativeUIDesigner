    { name: 'Pro', price: 25, yearlyPrice: 250, popular: true },
    { name: 'Enterprise', price: 50, yearlyPrice: 500 },
  ];
  
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-white p-8">

## Key Patterns in Generated Code

### State Management
```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
```

### Event Handling
```tsx
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  // Logic here
};
```

### Accessibility
```tsx
<button
  aria-label="Submit form"
  aria-describedby="error-message"
  onClick={handleClick}
>
  Submit
</button>
```

### Responsiveness
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

### Dark Mode
```tsx
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

## What the AI Understands

The AI is trained to recognize and generate:

### Layout Patterns
- Hero sections
- Navigation bars
- Card grids
- Sidebars
- Forms
- Dashboards
- Pricing tables
- Feature lists

### Interactive Elements
- Buttons
- Toggles/switches
- Tabs
- Accordions
- Modals (state-based)
- Dropdowns
- Forms with validation

### Visual Styles
- Dark mode
- Light mode
- Gradients
- Shadows
- Borders
- Hover effects
- Transitions

### Design Systems
- Color schemes
- Spacing
- Typography

## Tips for Better Prompts

### ‚úÖ Good Prompts
- "Clean finance dashboard with dark mode, cards, line chart, and keyboard navigation"
- "Responsive product grid with hover effects, filters sidebar, and mobile-friendly layout"
- "Contact form with validation states, success message, and accessible error handling"

### ‚ùå Vague Prompts
- "Make a website" (too broad)
- "Dashboard" (not enough detail)
- "Something nice" (no specifics)

### üéØ Prompt Tips
1. **Be specific**: Mention colors, layout, features
2. **Include interactivity**: Toggles, tabs, forms
3. **Mention accessibility**: Keyboard nav, ARIA
4. **Specify responsive needs**: Mobile, tablet, desktop
5. **State your style**: Clean, modern, minimal, bold

## Limitations

The AI-generated code:
- ‚úÖ Uses standard HTML/React elements
- ‚úÖ Implements Tailwind CSS classes
- ‚úÖ Includes basic interactivity with useState
- ‚ùå Cannot use external libraries (charts, icons)
- ‚ùå Cannot fetch real data (uses mock data)
- ‚ùå Cannot include images (uses placeholders)
- ‚ùå Limited to single-component scope

These limitations are by design for the MVP to ensure:
- Client-side preview works reliably
- No external dependencies needed
- Code is self-contained
- Fast generation and rendering
